Web application that allows users to create and manage their daily tasks. The user interface consists of a clean and minimalist design that is easy to navigate, with a text input box at the top where users can add new tasks to their list.
####
Once a task has been added, it appears in the main section of the page as an item in the TodoList. Each item includes a checkbox that can be checked off when the task is completed, as well as the name of the task itself. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from those that are still pending.
####
Users can also delete tasks from their list by clicking on a small "x". The TodoList is saved to local storage, so that when the user refreshes the page or closes and reopens their browser, their task list is still there.
####
Overall, your React TodoList project is a simple but useful tool for anyone who wants to keep track of their daily tasks in an organized and efficient manner. Well done on completing this project!
